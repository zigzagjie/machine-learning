  This article gives you some insights about how decision tree works in both regression and classification cases
  - Medium article [Decision Trees in Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-trees-in-machine-learning-641b9c4e8052).
  This article is similar the first one, but some links are useful.
